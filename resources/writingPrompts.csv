but despite the threadbare clothes he wore the most immaculate shoes I’d ever seen
10 for imagination
"A thick fog clung to the earth, shrouding"
After the storm
"Although she’d left, the room told me everything I needed to know about her"
As the dancers whirled in
Cold gnawed and the air
"Deep in reverie, I"
Every muscle ached
Every second felt like
He could make out only shapes
He had thick dark hair and
"He knew he had to say no, but the thought of doing so filled him with"
He no longer remembers
How to describe this city? I can only say
"Hubris, he thought, surveying"
"I could smell the electricity in the air, taste it on the molecules that entered"
"I don’t remember this myself, but my grandmother told me"
"I knew it was a lie from the beginning, but"
If time has wings then
It had rained for weeks and now
It seemed as though the bus would never reach
It seemed the spring would never come that year
It started like any other day
"It was a Saturday, or maybe a Friday, early evening and"
It was a time of
It was no ordinary mirror
It was the hottest summer afternoon.
It was the things that went unsaid that
It was the winter when
It was when the silence fell that
It’s always at twilight that
It’s so long ago now
My parents bedroom was
"One step, then the next, that was"
Outside the tent something rustled
"Peering through the half-open door, he could see"

"Rain pounded the earth. Head down, she walked, feeling.."
She reached out and touched
"She was in that liminal space, neither"
She was sitting on a train at the end of an ordinary day when bliss seized her
"She would change character, she decided, that was all"
So quiet that
Someone was telling a story and
Something moved on the horizon
"Staring at the screen, she knew that what she had refused to acknowledge these past months was now irrefutable"
Teatime was once
The cat dreams of
The day after the funeral
"The light was strange, a glow that"
The most beautiful place I’ve ever seen was
The movement was unlike any other
The only time I took a sleeper train
The person in the mirror is
The questions come at night and then I feel
The river snaked beside them as
The road ahead
The scent of
The shrill cry was
The sky was ashes and
The taste filled me with
The tears didn’t come until
The whole town seemed empty
"The wings rose first, then"
There are five magical winds that blow through
There seemed to be no way out
These are the rituals of my morning
These are the things I’ve forgotten
These are the ways I thought I knew him
"This was a place where the stream ran with tears, the grass"
This was the most frightening moment of his life
Tomorrow will be
"We played ‘What time is it, Mr Wolf?’ and"
What are you doing here?
What was lost was
"What was most disconcerting was that it alway occurred at the same time, down to the second, and each time"
When he left
"When I think about my family, I feel"
"Whispers, it was only whispers and shadows, and yet"
